# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is "Enlighten"?

Enlighten is a Non-profit organization helping the motivated, underprivileged
grade school and college students in USA and India.

### How does “Enlighten” do this?

  * The volunteers at Enlighten identify the deserving, motivated students from
economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who are at risk of dropping out of
school/college because they could not afford to pay for education
  * Communicate with the students about their goals
  * Help them by providing financial support by paying them for their education
  * Provide other non-financial assistance by mentoring and other resources

### Where does “Enlighten” get it’s funding?

Enlighten’s funding is obtained by generous and kind hearted donors who support the
cause. Enlighten also has various plans of fundraising in the future.

### How does “Enlighten” monitor that the funds are used for the right purpose?

Enlighten will pay the Tuition fees, hostel fees, lab fees and any other related
fees charged by the Institution, directly to the accredited educational
institutions, where the students are enrolled. For other related expenses like
books, the student will have to provide a letter of recommendation from their
Teachers/ Professors/Principals/Deans, as to the  requirement for the students
and the cost associated with that. Enlighten will pay/reimburse these costs.
Enlighten has several volunteers in India who would identify the students and
monitor the appropriations. Enlighten will also tie-up/partner with similar
organizations in India and use their assistance/resources.

### How many students will “Enlighten” fund each year?

While there is no set limit, the number of students we help depends on the funding
availability. Once we identify and adopt a student into our program, we would like
to see them be successful throughout their education until such time where they are
able to find a job. In some cases it may be a commitment for several years.

### What kind of non-financial assistance does “Enlighten” provide?

Enlighten will assist students by mentoring, helping students set their goals.
Examples: If a student has a fair idea of what he/she wants to be but does not how
to pursue, Enlighten will connect the student with college/career counselors to
assist them with this.

### Will Enlighten only pay for Educational Expenses?

The mission of this organization is to pay only for the educational expenses of
the underprivileged. However, the organization may assist a student with other
expenses from time to time based on the situation. Example: where a student may be
from an extremely underprivileged situation where he/she may need basic necessities
such as food and living as well. In such circumstance, Enlighten would pay for the
food and living of this student along with education. A student will not be able to
continue with education if basic necessities are not met.

### What kind of Donations will Enlighten collect?

Enlighten will collect Cash/Check donations as well as books, pencils and other supplies required for education. From time to time we will publish a wish list on our
website and donors can contact us with.

### How will the donors know their donation has been used and used for the right purpose?

Enlighten believes in transparency. A report of our operations will be published on
the website every quarter. Donors may contact the governing bodies at any time for
more information.

### Do you have a set percentage of how much of the total donations will be spent
domestically and how much would be spent abroad?

No we have not set a percentage. Since this is based on the  need and there are several needy students, it would be difficult to set a percentage.
